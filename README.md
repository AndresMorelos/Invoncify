## Why I change the name?

I really want to continue with the **Manta** Name but there could be a name conflict in the App review and they would reject the app.

[More information](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/support#supported-platforms).

Note that on Linux, some users might experience a GPU bug where the select options rendered as a black box, see [issue #128 of Invoncify](https://github.com/hql287/Manta/pull/128) and [issue #4322 of Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/4322). This can be fixed by disabling hardware acceleration like so:

```sh
invoncify --disable-hardware-acceleration
```

> Remember that doing this might lead to some degradation of the app's performance. This is why "the fix" is not included by default.
